### Hi there, I'm Kris ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with multiple years of experience in the JavaScript and Ruby ecosystems. 

I recently built [Kuri](https://kuri-dlq.github.io/), an open-source Dead-Letter Queue-as-a-Service (DLQaaS) for small distributed applications deployed on AWS infrastructure.
